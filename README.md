ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fake news articles using Logistic Regression. It classifies news content as either "Real" or "Fake" based on the textual content of the articles.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a binary classification system that can automatically identify whether a news article is fake or real, helping combat misinformation and promote trustworthy content.

ðŸ§  Model
We use Logistic Regression, a simple yet highly effective linear model for binary classification tasks, especially well-suited for text classification using techniques like TF-IDF.
